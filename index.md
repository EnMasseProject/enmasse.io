# Overview

EnMasse is an open source project for managed, self-service messaging on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io). EnMasse can run on your own infrastructure or in the cloud, and simplifies running a messaging infrastructure for your organization.

The <b>messaging service operator</b> can deploy and manage messaging infrastructure using cloud-native tools, while <b>independent teams</b> can request messaging resources using cloud-native APIs and tools. 

# Features

* Built-in <b>authentication</b> and <b>authorization</b> of clients and identity management
* Runs on <b>Kubernetes</b>: deploy <b>on-premise</b> or in the <b>cloud</b>
* Different <b>messaging patterns</b> like request-response, pub-sub and events
* Decouple <b>operation</b> of messaging infrastructure from <b>usage</b>

EnMasse can be used for many purposes, such as moving your messaging infrastructure to the cloud <b>without depending on a specific cloud provider</b>, building a scalable messaging backbone for <b>IoT</b>, or just as a <b>cloud-ready</b> version of a message broker.
